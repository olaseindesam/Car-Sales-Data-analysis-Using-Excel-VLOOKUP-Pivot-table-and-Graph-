# Scenario
 The data set of a car dealership that has several years of sales data, including the salesperson's name, customer name, the year and model of the car, how much the customer paid, and so on.

# Tool
- Excel

# Analysis steps 
- Imported the car_sales_data.csv file into Excel.
- Added a new column to the data to calculate the amount of commission (in dollars) earned by the salesperson
- Added a new column to calculate the dealership profit.
- Added a new column to calculate the age of the car when it was sold 
- Joseph Thompson sometimes goes by the name “Joe”. I Fix this so the naming is consistent throughout the file.
- The data were entered manually into the spreadsheet and a data entry error was made. I Identify the error and fix it. I used the filter tool for each column. For example, in - the car Year, I saw 3012 in one of the filters, this was changed to 2012 using find and replace.
- There are no blank records or columns.
